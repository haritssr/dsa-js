// recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instance of the same problem

// recursion is when a function calls itself

//every recursive solution need to have a base case -- a condition to terminate the recursion

// recursion might simplify solving a problem but might not the best solution. It might worst than iterative solution
